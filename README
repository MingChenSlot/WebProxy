STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION

We implement our program in C programming language. Thus, we need to implement most of the data structures by ourselves, including the Queue and linked list. In our program, we use multi-threads with thread pool to implement the web proxy server. 

Furthermore, since we tried to accomplish the cache part, we once implemented the http parsing. The two files are in http.c and cache.c. However, we'v not finished this part because we had some problems on dealing with the buf read from client. 





TEST RESULT

Throughput table:

Got this table with 100 threads in proxy server.

Throughput in MB/s, Response time in msec.
